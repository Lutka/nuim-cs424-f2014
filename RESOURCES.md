Scheme
------

You can use pretty much whatever implementation you want.  I'm using
"mzscheme" which is in the Debian package "racket".  You can install
it on Debian (or most Debian-derived distributions, e.g., Ubuntu) with
"apt-get install racket".  Or directly from http://racket-lang.org/
for various other platforms.

When you turn in a Scheme assignment, if you did it in some system
other than mzscheme, please include a comment at the top giving the
implementation so if I see constructs that won't work in mzscheme I'll
know what's going on.

Stay pure!
