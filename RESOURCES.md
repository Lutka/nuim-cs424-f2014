Resources for the class
=======================

Scheme
------

You can use pretty much whatever implementation you want.  I'm using
````mzscheme```` which is in the Debian package ````racket````.  You
can install it on Debian (or most Debian-derived distributions, e.g.,
Ubuntu) with ````apt-get install racket````, or directly from
http://racket-lang.org/ for various other platforms.

When you turn in a Scheme assignment, if you did it in some system
other than mzscheme, please include a comment at the top giving the
implementation so if I see constructs that won't work in mzscheme I'll
know what's going on.

Stay pure!
